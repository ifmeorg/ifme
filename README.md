# if me

[if me](https://www.if-me.org/) is a community for mental health experiences
that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies.
Trusted allies are the people we interact with on a daily basis, including
friends, family members, co-workers, teachers, and mental health workers.

Dealing with mental health is what makes us human. But for a lot of us, it's a
struggle to be open about it. Not everyone is a counsellor or therapist. The
people who we interact with everyday shape our emotions and behavior. Getting
them involved in mental health treatment is the key to recovery.

The live site can be found at [if-me.org](https://www.if-me.org/).

We use the wonderful [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) for
our code of conduct. Please
[read it](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
before joining our project.
