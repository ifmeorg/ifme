# if me

[if me](https://www.if-me.org/) is a community for mental health experiences
that encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies.
Trusted allies are the people we interact with on a daily basis, including
friends, family members, co-workers, teachers, and mental health workers.

Dealing with mental health is what makes us human. But for a lot of us, it's a
struggle to be open about it. Not everyone is a counsellor or therapist. The
people who we interact with everyday shape our emotions and behavior. Getting
them involved in mental health treatment is the key to recovery.

The live site can be found at [if-me.org](https://www.if-me.org/).

**Read about our project goals and how to contribute (not just as a developer) [here](https://github.com/julianguyen/ifme/blob/master/documentation/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

We use the wonderful [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) for
our code of conduct. Please
[read it](https://github.com/julianguyen/ifme/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
before joining our project.

## Tracking Issues and Committing Code

Information about workflows and contributions can be found in [WORKFLOW.md](https://www.github.com/julianguyen/ifme/blob/master/documentation/WORKFLOW.md).

## Contributor Blurb

In the spirit of open communication and community, we highly recommend that new
contributors write a blurb on themselves, what mental health means to them, and
why they are part of the project.

This also helps people to familiarize themselves with the code base! The live
contributors page can be found [here](http://www.if-me.org/contributors).
Contributor images must be at least 800x800 px and be in .jpg or .png format.
Please save the image as
`app/assets/images/contributors/firstname_lastname.png`! Add your blurb to
`doc/pages/blurbs.json`.

If you've contributed to the project but do not want to write a blurb, please
add your name and desired social media link to `doc/pages/contributors.json`.

Below are folks who have contributed via GitHub!

## Donate

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ifme).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of
the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our Open Collective by the
core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

We also have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ifme) page where you can give
monthly donations.
