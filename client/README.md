# React on Rails

This `client` folder is generated by the React on Rails gem.

NOTE: Avoid updating NPM package dependency versions, and do not recreate the `yarn.lock` file.
The package dependencies are in a fragile state where their versions as defined in the `yarn.lock`
file is necessary to have Karma tests correctly working.

See documentation [at github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) for details on how it is organized.

# Storybook

You can develop React components inside Storybook. To set up Storybook, you will need to set up the
_if me_ application first (see the root [README.md](../README.md) for installation instructions).

Then from the project root directory, execute the following:

```
rake react_on_rails:locale
cd client && yarn && yarn storybook
```

# Testing automation
