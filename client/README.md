# Storybook

You can develop React components inside Storybook. To set up Storybook, you will need to set up the
_if me_ application first (see the root [README.md](../README.md) for installation instructions).

Then from the project root directory, execute the following:

```
rake i18n:js:export
bin/start_app
# stop the process via CTRL+C
cd client && yarn && yarn storybook
```
