   premade1_description: '1) <b>Find a relaxed, comfortable position.</b> You could be seated on a chair or on the floor on a cushion. Keep your back upright, but not too tight. Hands resting wherever they’re comfortable. Tongue on the roof of your mouth or wherever it’s comfortable.<br><br>2) <b>Notice and relax your body.</b> Try to notice the shape of your body, its weight. Let yourself relax and become curious about your body seated here—the sensations it experiences, the touch, the connection with the floor or the chair. Relax any areas of tightness or tension. Just breathe.<br><br>3) <b>Tune into your breath.</b> Feel the natural flow of breath—in, out. You don’t need to do anything to your breath. Not long, not short, just natural. Notice where you feel your breath in your body. It might be in your abdomen. It may be in your chest or throat or in your nostrils. See if you can feel the sensations of breath, one breath at a time. When one breath ends, the next breath begins.<br><br>4) <b>Be kind to your wandering mind.</b> Now as you do this, you might notice that your mind may start to wander.
