# Add client/assets/ folders to asset pipeline's search path.
# If you do not want to move existing images and fonts from your Rails app
# you could also consider creating symlinks there that point to the original
# rails directories. In that case, you would not add these paths here.
# If you have a different server bundle file than your client bundle, you'll
# need to add it here, like this:
# Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( server-bundle.js )

# Add folder with webpack generated assets to assets.paths
Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("public", "webpack", Rails.env)
