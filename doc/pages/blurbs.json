My hope is to encourage others to feel more comfortable about sharing their experiences. Growing up as a daughter of Vietnamese refugee parents, it was difficult to talk about mental illness openly. I created if me as a tool to engage loved ones in mental health conversations. Working on the project openly has helped me to further explore my own mental health.",

    "profile":"As a health science student I have been exposed medical literature that focuses on neuroplasticity, the idea that our environment and actions can change neural circuitry and pathways, and its role in shaping mental health disorders. For example, studies shows the in people with OCD, there is hyperconnectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus, structures of the brain that are responsible for decision-making and thinking. Thus novel treatment of OCD focuses on targeting these principles and beliefs these obsessions and compulsions are founded on in order to rewire the brain. I believe if me provides a platform to habitually reflect and help manage one's wellbeing in addition to formal medical treatment.",

And what makes it even more distinctive is its target audience – because with the stigmas surrounding mental health and various other things, it is very difficult for individuals with mental health concerns to find the right kind of support, because only the individual can determine if something is actually benefitting them. if me allows you to build your own support system and change it as you please which I find very unique, and something everyone should at least give a try, regardless of whether or not  you currently have mental health concerns. I enjoy learning and helping make a meaningful impact, and contributing to if me helps me do that.",

Mental health is a personal topic but good mental health relies on support, and through my interdisciplinary background I hope to bring my unique perspective here. Mental illness has been minimized in my community as a South Asian. You hear stories of family or friends in whispers. Only within my generation onward, there has been a minor shift, and I hope to see it open further. Personally, I have learnt to silently cope and create methods to keep my trajectory towards success without alerting anyone. Which is why I understand the need for an open-source project like if me. Sometimes, you need support from accepting family or friends without the eyes of an entire community on you. I think if me provides us with a safe space that extends out from our own selves and into the few that we trust. Building a closed community, that is free and open to individuals from all backgrounds, is a necessity. Access to mental health and resources need to reach those who need it most, and having an open source platform has been vital for it.",
