# Contributing

[if me](http://www.if-me.org) is a community for mental health experiences that
encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies. Trusted
allies are the people we interact with on a daily basis, including friends,
family members, co-workers, teachers, and mental health workers.

Dealing with mental health is what makes us human. But for a lot of us, it's a
struggle to be open about it. Not everyone is a counsellor or therapist. The
people who we interact with everyday shape our emotions and behavior. Getting
them involved in mental health treatment is the key to recovery.

We're built and maintained by volunteers of many different backgrounds and skill
sets. We're always looking for ideas from everyone, including mental health
advocates, health professionals, software developers, and user experience
designers!

We use the wonderful [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) for
our code of conduct. Please [read it](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
before joining our project.

Please check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/wiki) for full documentation.
