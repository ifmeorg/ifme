# Contributing to if me

[if me](http://www.if-me.org) is a community for mental health experiences that
encourages people to share their personal stories with trusted allies. Trusted
allies are the people we interact with on a daily basis, including friends,
family members, co-workers, teachers, and mental health workers.

Dealing with mental health is what makes us human. But for a lot of us, it's a
struggle to be open about it. Not everyone is a counsellor or therapist. The
people who we interact with everyday shape our emotions and behavior. Getting
them involved in mental health treatment is the key to recovery.

We're built and maintained by volunteers of many different backgrounds and skill
sets. We're always looking for ideas from everyone, including mental health
advocates, health professionals, software developers, and user experience
designers!

We use the wonderful [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) for
our code of conduct. Please [read it](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
before joining our project.

### Goals

* Allow users to write about their experiences (Moments) similar to a blog and get feedback and support from their allies
* Create personalized categories and moods to organize Moments and Strategies
* Develop and share Strategies to solve problems and maintain healthy self-care goals
* Keep track of medications and create alerts for them
* Create support groups whether online or offline and keep track of sessions

## Contributor Roles

We've formalized processes for contributing as a designer, developer, writer, and user tester. We're an open and evolving project, so if you don't see your interested role, please let us know and we will work with you to create it!

The first task to do is to [email us](mailto:join.ifme@gmail.com) and tell us about yourself and what you're interested in working on. We'll send you an invitation to join our [Slack](http://ifme.slack.com) team. This is our primary communication tool. [Julia Nguyen](https://twitter.com/fleurchild), our founder, will plan out with you what you'll be working on.

### Designer

Please check out our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/issues) for tasks to work on! Stories labelled with `design` are relevant to designers. Any future issues should also use this label too!

Many of our developer tasks will require designer collaboration, please use Slack for communication. We also have a public `#design` channel.

### Developer
