# FriendlyId

Please ask questions on [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/friendly-id) using the
"friendly_id" or "friendly-id" tag. Prior to asking, search and see if your
question has already been anwered.

Please only post issues in Github issues for actual bugs.

I am asking people to do this because the same questions keep getting asked
over and over and over again in the issues.
