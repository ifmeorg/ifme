title: Ruby rb_ary_store Function Multiple Overflows
date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  Multiple integer overflows in the rb_ary_store function
  in Ruby 1.8.4 and earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, and
  1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
  or cause a denial of service via unknown vectors, a different issue than CVE-2008-2662,
  CVE-2008-2664, and CVE-2008-2725. NOTE: as of 20080624, there has been inconsistent
  usage of multiple CVE identifiers related to Ruby. The CVE description should be
  regarded as authoritative, although it is likely to change.
