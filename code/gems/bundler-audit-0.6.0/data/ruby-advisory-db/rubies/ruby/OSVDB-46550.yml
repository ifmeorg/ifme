title: Ruby rb_str_buf_append Function Multiple Overflows
date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  Multiple integer overflows in the rb_str_buf_append
  function in Ruby 1.8.4 and earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230,
  1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22, and 1.9.0 before 1.9.0-2 allow context-dependent attackers
  to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via unknown vectors that
  trigger memory corruption, a different issue than CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
  and CVE-2008-2725. NOTE: as of 20080624, there has been inconsistent usage of multiple
  CVE identifiers related to Ruby. This CVE description should be regarded as authoritative,
  although it is likely to change.
