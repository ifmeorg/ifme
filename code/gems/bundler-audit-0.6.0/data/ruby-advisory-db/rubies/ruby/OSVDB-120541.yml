  Ruby lib/openssl/ssl.rb verify_certificate_identity() Function X.509
  Certificate Improper Hostname Verification MitM Spoofing
date: 2014-03-16
description: |
  Ruby contains a flaw related to certificate validation in
  verify_certificate_identity() function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb. The issue is
  due to the server hostname not being verified to match a domain name in the
  Subject's Common Name (CN) or SubjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate.
  By spoofing the TLS/SSL server via a certificate that appears valid, an
  attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic (e.g. MiTM, DNS cache
  poisoning) can disclose and optionally manipulate transmitted data.
