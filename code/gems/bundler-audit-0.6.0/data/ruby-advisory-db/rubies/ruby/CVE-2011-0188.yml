title: Ruby memory corruption in BigDecimal on 64bit platforms
date: 2011-03-01
description: |
  The VpMemAlloc function in bigdecimal.c in the BigDecimal class in Ruby
  1.9.2-p136 and earlier, as used on Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.7 and other
  platforms, does not properly allocate memory, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application
  crash) via vectors involving creation of a large BigDecimal value within a
  64-bit process, related to an "integer truncation issue."
