title: Ruby rb_str_format Function Unspecified Memory Corruption
date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  The rb_str_format function in Ruby 1.8.4 and earlier,
  1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, 1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22, and 1.9.0
  before 1.9.0-2 allows context-dependent attackers to trigger memory corruption via
  unspecified vectors related to alloca, a different issue than CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663,
  and CVE-2008-2725. NOTE: as of 20080624, there has been inconsistent usage of multiple
  CVE identifiers related to Ruby. The CVE description should be regarded as authoritative,
  although it is likely to change.
