title: Ruby file.c rb_get_path_check Function NULL Byte File Path Request Arbitrary
  File Creation
date: 2012-10-12
description: |
  Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered by a NULL byte in the rb_get_path_check
  function in file.c when handling a file path request. This may allow a context-dependent
  attacker to create arbitrary files.
