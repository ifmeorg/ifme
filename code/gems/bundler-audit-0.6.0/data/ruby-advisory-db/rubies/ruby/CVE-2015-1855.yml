title: Ruby OpenSSL Hostname Verification
date: 2015-04-13
description: |
  After reviewing RFC 6125 and RFC 5280, we found multiple violations of matching
  hostnames and particularly wildcard certificates.
  Rubyâ€™s OpenSSL extension will now provide a string-based matching algorithm which
  follows more strict behavior, as recommended by these RFCs. In particular,
  matching of more than one wildcard per subject/SAN is no-longer allowed. As well,
  comparison of these values is now case-insensitive.
patched_versions:
  - ~> 2.0.0.645
  - ~> 2.1.6
  - ">= 2.2.2"
