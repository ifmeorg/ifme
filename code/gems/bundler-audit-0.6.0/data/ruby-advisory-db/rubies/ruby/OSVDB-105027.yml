  LibYAML yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes() Function Crafted Document Parsing Heap
  Buffer Overflow
date: 2014-03-26
description: |
  LibYAML contains an overflow condition in the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes()
  function that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated
  when parsing a specially crafted YAML document. This may allow a
  context-dependent attacker to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, resulting
  in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary
  code in a program linked against the library.
