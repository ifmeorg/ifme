title: Ruby rb_ary_splice Function Overflow (beg + rlen)
date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  A buffer overflow exists in Ruby. The rb_ary_splice function fails to
  validate unspecified data resulting in an integer overflow. With a specially crafted
  request, a context-dependent attacker can cause arbitrary code execution resulting
  in a loss of integrity.
