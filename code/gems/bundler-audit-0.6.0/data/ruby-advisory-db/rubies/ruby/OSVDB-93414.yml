  Ruby Multiple Module Object $SAFE Level Verification System Call Tainted
  String Injection
date: 2013-05-14
description: |
  Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when the Fiddle and DL modules fail to
  properly verify the $SAFE level when handling certain objects. This may allow
  a remote attacker to inject tainted strings into a system call.
