title: Ruby Exception#to_s / NameError#to_s Methods Safe Level Security Bypass
date: 2012-10-12
description: |
  Ruby 1.9.3 before patchlevel 286 and 2.0 before revision r37068 allows
  context-dependent attackers to bypass safe-level restrictions and modify
  untainted strings via the (1) exc_to_s or (2) name_err_to_s API function,
  which marks the string as tainted, a different vulnerability than
  CVE-2012-4466. NOTE: this issue might exist because of a CVE-2011-1005
  regression.
