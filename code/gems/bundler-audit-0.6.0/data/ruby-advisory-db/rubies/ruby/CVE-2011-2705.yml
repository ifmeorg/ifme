title: Ruby Random Number Generation Local Denial Of Service Vulnerability
date: 2011-07-02
description: |
  The SecureRandom.random_bytes function in lib/securerandom.rb in Ruby before
  1.8.7-p352 and 1.9.x before 1.9.2-p290 relies on PID values for
  initialization, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
  predict the result string by leveraging knowledge of random strings obtained
  in an earlier process with the same PID. 
cvss_v2: 5.0
patched_versions:
  - ~> 1.8.7.352
  - ">= 1.9.2.290"
