  Ruby FileUtils.remove_entry_secure Method File Symlink Race Condition Arbitrary
  File Deletion
date: 2011-02-19
description: |
  Ruby contains a race condition flaw that may allow a malicious local user to
  delete arbitrary files on the system. The issue is due to the
  'FileUtils.remove_entry_secure' method creating temporary files insecurely.
  It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack to cause the
  program to unexpectedly write to, or overwrite an attacker specified file.
