title: Ruby Net::HTTPS library does not validate server certificate CN
date: 2007-10-08
description: |
  The (1) Net::ftptls, (2) Net::telnets, (3) Net::imap, (4) Net::pop, and (5)
  Net::smtp libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 do not verify that the
  commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name in a
  request sent over SSL, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
  intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web
  site, different components than CVE-2007-5162.
