title: Ruby 'OCSP_basic_verify()' X.509 Certificate Verification Vulnerability
date: 2009-01-29
description: |
  ext/openssl/ossl_ocsp.c in Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 does not properly check the
  return value from the OCSP_basic_verify function, which might allow remote
  attackers to successfully present an invalid X.509 certificate, possibly
  involving a revoked certificate.
