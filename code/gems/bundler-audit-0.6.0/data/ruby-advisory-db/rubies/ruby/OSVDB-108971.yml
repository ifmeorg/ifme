title: Ruby pack.c encodes() Function Remote Stack Buffer Overflow
date: 2014-07-09
description: |
  Ruby contains an overflow condition in the encodes() function in pack.c. The
  issue is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when
  allocating buffer lengths. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a
  stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially
  allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
