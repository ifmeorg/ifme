  Ruby Properly initialize the random number generator when forking new process
date: 2011-07-02
description: |
  Ruby before 1.8.6-p114 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which
  makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of
  random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a
  different child process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900.
