title: Ruby Exception#to_s Method Safe Level Security Bypass
date: 2011-02-18
description: |
  Ruby contains a flaw related to the safe-level feature. The issue is
  triggered when a context-dependent attacker exploits a flaw within the exception
  '#to_s' handling. This may allow an attacker to bypass safe-level protection and
  modify strings via the 'Exception#to_s' method.
