title: Heap Overflow in Floating Point Parsing (CVE-2013-4164)
date: 2013-11-22
description: |
  Heap-based buffer overflow in Ruby 1.8, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p484, 2.0 before 2.0.0-p353, 2.1 before
  2.1.0 preview2, and trunk before revision 43780 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
  denial of service (segmentation fault) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a string that is
  converted to a floating point value, as demonstrated using (1) the to_f method or (2) JSON.parse.

patched_versions:
  - ~> 1.9.3.484
