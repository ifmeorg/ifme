title: Ruby Random Number Generation Local Denial Of Service Vulnerability
date: 2011-07-02
description: |
  Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which
  makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of
  random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a
  different child process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900. NOTE: this issue
  exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.
