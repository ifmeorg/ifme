title: Ruby rb_ary_splice Function REALLOC_N Overflow
date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  Integer overflow in the (1) rb_ary_splice function
  in Ruby 1.8.4 and earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, and
  1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22; and (2) the rb_ary_replace function in 1.6.x allows context-dependent
  attackers to trigger memory corruption via unspecified vectors, aka the "REALLOC_N"
  variant, a different issue than CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, and CVE-2008-2664.
  NOTE: as of 20080624, there has been inconsistent usage of multiple CVE identifiers
  related to Ruby. The CVE description should be regarded as authoritative, although
  it is likely to change.
