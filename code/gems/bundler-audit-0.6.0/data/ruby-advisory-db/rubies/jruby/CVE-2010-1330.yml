  JRuby XSS in the regular expression engine when processing invalid UTF-8 byte
  sequences
date: 2010-04-26
description: |
  The regular expression engine in JRuby before 1.4.1, when $KCODE is set to
  'u', does not properly handle characters immediately after a UTF-8
  character, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks via a crafted string.
cvss_v2: 4.3
