title: JRuby Null Byte Request Arbitrary File Access
date: 2010-05-26
description: |
  JRuby contains a flaw that is due to the program failing to properly check
  for null byte requests in certain file operations. This may allow a remote
  attacker to gain access to arbitrary files. No further details are available.
