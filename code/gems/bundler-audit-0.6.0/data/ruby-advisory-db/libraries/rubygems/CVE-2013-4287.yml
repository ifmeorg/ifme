title: RubyGems Multiple API Call Version Validation CPU Consumption DoS
date: 2013-09-09
description: |
  RubyGems contains a flaw that may allow a denial of service. The issue is
  triggered when handling the gem build, Gem::Package, or Gem::PackageTask API
  calls, which attempt to validate the version of the program. This may allow a
  context-dependent attacker to cause a consumption of CPU resources and crash
  the program.
