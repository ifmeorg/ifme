  RubyGems installer.rb extract_files Function Crafted GEM Package Arbitrary
  File Overwrite
date: 2007-01-22
description: |
  The extract_files function in installer.rb in RubyGems before 0.9.1 does not
  check whether files exist before overwriting them, which allows user-assisted
  remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or
  execute arbitrary code via crafted GEM packages.
