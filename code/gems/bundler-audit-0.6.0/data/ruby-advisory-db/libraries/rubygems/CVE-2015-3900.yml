  RubyGems remote_fetcher.rb api_endpoint() Function Missing SRV Record
  Hostname Validation Request Hijacking
date: 2015-05-14
description: |
  RubyGems contains a flaw in the api_endpoint() function in remote_fetcher.rb
  that is triggered when handling hostnames in SRV records. With a specially
  crafted response, a context-dependent attacker may conduct DNS hijacking
  attacks.
