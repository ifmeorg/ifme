title: Ruby-Saml Gem is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
date: 2015-02-03
description: |
  ruby-saml contains a flaw that is triggered as the URI value of a SAML response is
  not properly sanitized through a prepared statement. This may allow a remote
  attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine.
