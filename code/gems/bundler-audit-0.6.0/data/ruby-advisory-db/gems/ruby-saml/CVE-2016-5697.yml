title: XML signature wrapping attack
date: 2016-06-24
description: |
  ruby-saml prior to version 1.3.0 is vulnerable to an XML signature wrapping attack
  in the specific scenario where there was a signature that referenced at the same time
  2 elements (but past the scheme validator process since 1 of the element was inside
  the encrypted assertion).

  ruby-saml users must update to 1.3.0, which implements 3 extra validations to
  mitigate this kind of attack.
cvss_v3: 6.1
patched_versions:
  - ">= 1.3.0"
