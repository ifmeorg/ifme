  Ember.js Potential XSS Exploit With User-Supplied Data When Binding
  Primitive Values
date: 2014-01-14
description: |
  In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.  However, we have
  identified a vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted
  into the innerHTML string without being sanitized.

  When a primitive value is used as the Handlebars context, that value is not
  properly escaped.  An example of this would be using the `{{each}}` helper to
  iterate over an array of user-supplied strings and using `{{this}}` inside the
  block to display each string.

  In applications that contain templates whose context is a primitive value and
  use the `{{this}}` keyword to display that value, a specially-crafted payload
  could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain
  ("XSS").

  This vulnerability affects applications that contain templates whose context is
  set to a user-supplied primitive value (such as a string or number) and also
  contain the `{{this}}` special Handlebars variable to display the value.
