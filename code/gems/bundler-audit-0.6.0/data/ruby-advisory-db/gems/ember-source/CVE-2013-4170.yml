  Ember.js Potential XSS Exploit When Binding `tagName` to User-Supplied Data
date: 2013-07-25
description: |
  In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content
  before inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.
  However, the `tagName` property of an `Ember.View` was inserted into
  such a string without being sanitized. This means that if an
  application assigns a view's `tagName` to user-supplied data, a
  specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the
  context of the current domain ("XSS").

  This vulnerability only affects applications that assign or bind
  user-provided content to `tagName`.
