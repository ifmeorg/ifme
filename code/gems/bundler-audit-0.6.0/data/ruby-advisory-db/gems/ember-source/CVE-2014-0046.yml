title: Ember.js XSS Vulnerability With {{link-to}} Helper in Non-block Form
date: 2014-02-07
description: |
  In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.  However, a change made
  to the implementation of the {{link-to}} helper means that any user-supplied
  data bound to the {{link-to}} helper's title attribute will not be escaped
  correctly.

  In applications that use the {{link-to}} helper in non-block form and bind
  the title attribute to user-supplied content, a specially-crafted payload
  could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain
  ("XSS").

  All users running an affected release and binding user-supplied data to the
  {{link-to}} helper's title attribute should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.
