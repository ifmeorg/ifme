  Ruby on Rails actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb
  with_http_digest Helper Method Remote DoS
date: 2012-07-26

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow a remote denial of service.
  The issue is triggered when an error occurs in
  actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb when the
  with_http_digest helper method is being used. This may allow a remote
  attacker to cause a loss of availability for the program.
