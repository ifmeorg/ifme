title: XSS Vulnerability in number_to_currency, number_to_percentage and number_to_human
date: 2014-02-18

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
  This flaw exists because the actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/number_helper.rb
  script does not validate input to the 'number_to_currency', 'number_to_percentage',
  and 'number_to_human' helpers before returning it to users. This may allow a
  remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary
  script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between
  their browser and the server.
