title: XSS Vulnerability in simple_format helper
date: 2013-12-03

description: |
  There is a vulnerability in the simple_format helper in Ruby on Rails.
  The simple_format helper converts user supplied text into html text
  which is intended to be safe for display. A change made to the
  implementation of this helper means that any user provided HTML
  attributes will not be escaped correctly. As a result of this error,
  applications which pass user-controlled data to be included as html
  attributes will be vulnerable to an XSS attack.
