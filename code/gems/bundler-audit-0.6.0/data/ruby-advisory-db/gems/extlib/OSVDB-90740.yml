title: extlib Gem for Ruby Type Casting Parameter Parsing Remote Code Execution 
date: 2013-01-08

description: |
  extlib Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when a type casting
  error occurs during the parsing of parameters. This may allow a
  context-dependent attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
