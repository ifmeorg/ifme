  Rack Long String Parsing Memory Consumption Remote DoS
date: 2013-01-07

description: |
  Rack contains a flaw that may allow a remote denial of service. The issue is
  triggered when parsing an overly long string. With a specially crafted string,
  a remote attacker can cause a consumption of memory. This will result in a
  loss of availability for the webserver.
