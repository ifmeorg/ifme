  Rack Regular Expressions Engine Content-Disposition Header Parsing Infinite Loop Remote DoS
date: 2012-05-04

description: |
  Rack contains a flaw in the Regular Expressions Engine that may allow a remote
  denial of service. The issue is triggered when parsing context-disposition
  headers. With a specially crafted header, a remote attacker can cause an
  infinite loop, which will result in a loss of availability for the webserver.
