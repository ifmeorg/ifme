  Rack Rack::Session::Cookie Function Timing Attack Remote Code Execution
date: 2013-02-07

description: |
  Rack contains a flaw that is due to an error in the Rack::Session::Cookie
  function. Users of the Marshal session cookie encoding (the default), are
  subject to a timing attack that may lead an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code. This attack is more practical against 'cloud' users as intra-cloud
  latencies are sufficiently low to make the attack viable.
