title: Dragonfly Gem for Ruby Image Uploading & Processing Remote Command Execution
date: 2014-08-25
description: |
  Dragonfly Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in Uploading & Processing that is due
  to the gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to imagemagicks convert.
  This may allow a remote attacker to gain read/write access to the filesystem
  and execute arbitrary commands.

  This gem has been renamed. Please use "dragonfly" from now on.
patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.8.4"
