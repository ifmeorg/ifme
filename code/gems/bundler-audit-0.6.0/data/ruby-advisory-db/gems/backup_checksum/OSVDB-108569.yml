title: backup_checksum Gem for Ruby /lib/backup/cli/utility.rb Process List Local Plaintext Password Disclosure
date: 2014-06-30
description: |
  backup_checksum Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/backup/cli/utility.rb
  that is triggered as the program displays password information in plaintext
  in the process list. This may allow a local attacker to gain access to
  password information.
