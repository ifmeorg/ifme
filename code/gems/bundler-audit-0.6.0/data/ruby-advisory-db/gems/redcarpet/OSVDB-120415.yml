title: redcarpet Gem for Ruby markdown.c parse_inline() Function XSS
date: 2015-04-07
description: |
  redcarpet Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the parse_inline() function in
  markdown.c does not validate input before returning it to users. This may
  allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would
  execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust
  relationship between their browser and the server.
