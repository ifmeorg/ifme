title: RedCloth Gem for Ruby Textile Link Parsing XSS
date: 2012-02-29
description: |
  RedCloth Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. This flaw exists because the program does not validate input when
  parsing textile links before returning it to users. This may allow a remote
  attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary
  script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between
  their browser and the server.
