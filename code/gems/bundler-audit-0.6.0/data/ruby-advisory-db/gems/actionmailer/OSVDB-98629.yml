title: Action Mailer Gem for Ruby contains a possible DoS Vulnerability
date: 2013-10-16
description: Action Mailer Gem for Ruby contains a format string flaw in
  the Log Subscriber component. The issue is triggered as format string
  specifiers (e.g. %s and %x) are not properly sanitized in user-supplied
  input when handling email addresses. This may allow a remote attacker
  to cause a denial of service
