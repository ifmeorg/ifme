title: espeak-ruby Gem for Ruby Arbitrary Command Execution
date: 2016-04-13

description: |
  espeak-ruby passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell
  command. An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying
  the strings that are passed as arguments to the speak, save, bytes
  and bytes_wav methods in the lib/espeak/speech.rb library.
