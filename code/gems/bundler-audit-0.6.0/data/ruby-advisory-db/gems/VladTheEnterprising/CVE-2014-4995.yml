title: VladTheEnterprising Gem for Ruby /tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host} Symlink Multiple Impact
date: 2014-06-30
description: |
  VladTheEnterprising Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as the program creates
  temporary files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use
  a symlink attack against the /tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host} file they can
  overwrite arbitrary files, gain access to the MySQL root password,
  or inject arbitrary commands.
