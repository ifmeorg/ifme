title: git-fastclone permits arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules
date: 2015-12-11
description: |
  Git allows executing arbitrary shell commands using git-remote-ext via a
  remote URLs. Normally git never requests URLs that the user doesn't
  specifically request, so this is not a serious security concern. However,
  submodules did allow the remote repository to specify what URL to clone
  from.

  If an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive clone from a
  repository they control, they can get a client to run an arbitrary shell
  command. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted git clone,
  they could exploit this. The ext command will be run if the repository is
  recursively cloned or if submodules are updated. This attack works when
  cloning both local and remote repositories.
