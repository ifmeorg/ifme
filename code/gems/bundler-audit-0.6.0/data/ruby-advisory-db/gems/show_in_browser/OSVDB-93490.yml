title: Show In Browser Gem for Ruby /tmp/browser.html Arbitrary Script Injection
date: 2013-05-17
description: Show In Browser Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when the application does not validate input passed via the /tmp/browser.html file. This may allow a local attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser.
