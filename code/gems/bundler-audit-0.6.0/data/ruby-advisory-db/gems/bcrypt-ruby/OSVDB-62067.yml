title: bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby incorrect encoding of non US-ASCII characters (JRuby only)
date: 2010-02-01
description: |
  bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby suffered from a bug related to character
  encoding that substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords
  containing non US-ASCII characters. An incorrect encoding step
  transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to hashing. In the
  worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII characters,
  this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other such passwords
  of the same length. This issue only affects the JRuby implementation.

  This gem has been renamed. Please use "bcrypt" from now on.
