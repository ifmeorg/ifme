  xaviershay-dm-rails Gem for Ruby exposes sensitive information via the process table
date: 2015-02-17
description: |
  xaviershay-dm-rails Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the execute() function
  in /datamapper/dm-rails/blob/master/lib/dm-rails/storage.rb. The issue is
  due to the function exposing sensitive information via the process table.
  This may allow a local attack to gain access to MySQL credential information.
