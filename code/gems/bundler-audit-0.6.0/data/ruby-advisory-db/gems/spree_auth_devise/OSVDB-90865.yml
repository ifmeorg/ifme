  Spree app/models/spree/user.rb Mass Role Assignment Remote Privilege
  Escalation
date: 2013-02-21
description: |
  Spree contains a flaw that leads to unauthorized privileges being gained. The
  issue is triggered as certain input related to mass role assignment in
  app/models/spree/user.rb is not properly verified before being used to update
  a user. This may allow a remote attacker to assign arbitrary roles and gain
  elevated administrative privileges.
