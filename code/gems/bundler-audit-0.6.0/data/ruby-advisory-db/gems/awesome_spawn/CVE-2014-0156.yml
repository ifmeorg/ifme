title: OS command injection flaw in awesome_spawn
date: 2014-03-28

description: >-
  Awesome spawn contains OS command injection vulnerability, which allows
  execution of additional commands passed to Awesome spawn as arguments, e.g.
  AwesomeSpawn.run('ls',:params => {'-l' => ";touch haxored"}). If untrusted
  input was included in command arguments, attacker could use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary command.
