title: rgpg Gem for Ruby lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb Remote Command Execution
date: 2013-08-02
description: |
  rgpg Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the GpgHelper module
  (lib/rgpg/gpg_helper.rb). The issue is due to the program failing to properly
  sanitize user-supplied input before being used in the system() function for
  execution. This may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
