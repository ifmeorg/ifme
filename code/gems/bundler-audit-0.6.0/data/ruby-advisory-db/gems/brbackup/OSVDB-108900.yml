title: brbackup Gem for Ruby dbuser Variable Shell Metacharacter Injection Remote Command Execution
date: 2014-07-09
description: |
  brbackup Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered as input passed
  via the 'dbuser' variable is not properly sanitized. This may allow a
  remote attacker to inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary
  commands.
