title: Mail Gem for Ruby File Delivery Method to Parameter Traversal Arbitrary File Manipulation
date: 2012-03-14

description: |
  Mail Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to traverse outside of a restricted path. The issue is due to the program not properly sanitizing user input, specifically directory traversal style attacks (e.g., ../../) supplied via the 'to' parameter within the delivery method. This directory traversal attack would allow the attacker to modify arbitrary files.
