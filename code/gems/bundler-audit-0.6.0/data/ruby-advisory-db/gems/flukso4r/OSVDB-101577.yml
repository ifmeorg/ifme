title: flukso4r Gem for Ruby /lib/flukso/R.rb Arbitrary Command Execution
date: 2013-12-31
description: flukso4r Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/flukso/R.rb that is due to the application failing to properly validate user-supplied input. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
