  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in doorkeeper 1.4.0
  and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the user's OAuth
  autorization code. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
  identifier CVE-2014-8144.

  Doorkeeper's endpoints didn't have CSRF protection. Any HTML document
  on the Internet can then read a user's authorization code with
  arbitrary scope from any Doorkeeper-compatible Rails app you are
  logged in.
