title: 'rubygem-rest-client: session fixation vulnerability via Set-Cookie headers in 30x redirection responses'
date: 2015-03-24
description: |
  rest-client in abstract_response.rb improperly handles Set-Cookie headers on
  HTTP 30x redirection responses. Any cookies will be forwarded to the
  redirection target regardless of domain, path, or expiration.

  If you control a redirection source, you can cause rest-client to perform a
  request to any third-party domain with cookies of your choosing, which may be
  useful in performing a session fixation attack.

  If you control a redirection target, you can steal any cookies set by the
  third-party redirection request.
