title: Oracle "enhanced" ActiveRecord Gem for Ruby :limit / :offset SQL Injection
date: 2008-10-10
description: |
  Oracle "enhanced" ActiveRecord Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that may allow an
  attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the
  program not properly sanitizing user-supplied input related to the :limit and
  :offset functions. This may allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL
  queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure
  of arbitrary data.
