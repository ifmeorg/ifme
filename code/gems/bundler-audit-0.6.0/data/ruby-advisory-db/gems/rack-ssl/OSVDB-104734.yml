title: rack-ssl Gem for Ruby Error Message Reflected XSS 
date: 2013-07-09
description: rack-ssl Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the program does not validate input passed via error messages before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
