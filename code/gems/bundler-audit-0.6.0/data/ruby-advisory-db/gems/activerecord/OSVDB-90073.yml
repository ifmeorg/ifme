  Ruby on Rails Active Record +serialize+ Helper YAML Attribute Handling Remote
  Code Execution 
date: 2013-02-11

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the +serialize+ helper in the Active Record.
  The issue is triggered when the system is configured to allow users to
  directly provide values to be serialized and deserialized using YAML.
  With a specially crafted YAML attribute, a remote attacker can deserialize
  arbitrary YAML and execute code associated with it.
