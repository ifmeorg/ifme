title: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Active Record
date: 2014-07-02

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection attack.
  The issue is due to the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record not properly
  sanitizing user-supplied input when quoting ranges. This may allow a remote
  attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database,
  allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
