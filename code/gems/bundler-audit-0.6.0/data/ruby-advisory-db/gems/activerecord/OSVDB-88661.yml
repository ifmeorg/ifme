title: Ruby on Rails find_by_* Methods Authlogic SQL Injection Bypass
date: 2012-12-22

description: |
  Due to the way dynamic finders in Active Record extract options from method
  parameters, a method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope.  Carefully
  crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQL.
