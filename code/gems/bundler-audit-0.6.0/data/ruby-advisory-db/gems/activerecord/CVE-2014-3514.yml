title: Data Injection Vulnerability in Active Record 
date: 2014-08-18

description: >-
  The create_with functionality in Active Record was implemented
  incorrectly and completely bypasses the strong parameters
  protection. Applications which pass user-controlled values to
  create_with could allow attackers to set arbitrary attributes on
  models.
