title: Ruby on Rails where Method ActiveRecord Class SQL Injection
date: 2012-05-31

description: |
  Ruby on Rails (RoR) contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to carry out
  an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the ActiveRecord class not
  properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'where' method. This may
  allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in an application
  built on RoR, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
