title: Loofah HTML and XSS injection vulnerability
date: 2012-09-08

description: |
  Loofah Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the
  Loofah::HTML::Document\#text function passes properly sanitized
  user-supplied input to the Loofah::XssFoliate and
  Loofah::Helpers\#strip_tags functions which convert input back to
  text. This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted
  request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser
  within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.

cvss_v2: 5.0

patched_versions:
