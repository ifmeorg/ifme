title: bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby incorrect encoding of non US-ASCII characters (JRuby only)
date: 2010-02-01
description: |
  bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby suffered from a bug related to character
  encoding that substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords
  containing non US-ASCII characters. An incorrect encoding step
  transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to hashing. In the
  worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII characters,
  this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other such passwords
  of the same length. This issue only affects the JRuby implementation.
