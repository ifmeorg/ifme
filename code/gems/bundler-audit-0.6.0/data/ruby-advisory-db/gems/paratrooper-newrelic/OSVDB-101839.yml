title: Paratrooper-newrelic Gem for Ruby Process Listing API Key Local Disclosure
date: 2014-01-08
description: |
  Paratrooper-newrelic Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in
  /lib/paratrooper-newrelic.rb. The issue is triggered when the script exposes
  the API key, allowing a local attacker to gain access to it by monitoring the
  process tree.
cvss_v2: 2.1
