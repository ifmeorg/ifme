title:  Net::LDAP for Ruby lib/net/ldap/password.rb SSHA Password Generation Weak Salt
date: 2014-02-13
description: Net::LDAP for Ruby contains a flaw in lib/net/ldap/password.rb. The
  issue is due to the program generating SSHA passwords with a weak salt value
  that is between 0 and 999. This may allow a local attacker to more easily gain
  access to password information.
