title: colorscore Gem for Ruby lib/colorscore/histogram.rb Arbitrary Command Injection
date: 2016-01-04
description: |
  The contents of the `image_path`, `colors`, and `depth` variables generated
  from possibly user-supplied input are passed directly to the shell via
  `convert ...`.

  If a user supplies a value that includes shell metacharacters such as ';', an
  attacker may be able to execute shell commands on the remote system as the
  user id of the Ruby process.

  To resolve this issue, the aforementioned variables (especially `image_path`)
  must be sanitized for shell metacharacters.
