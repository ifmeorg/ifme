title: MiniMagick Gem for Ruby URI Handling Arbitrary Command Injection
date: 2013-03-12
description: |
  MiniMagick Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered during the handling
  of specially crafted input from an untrusted source passed via a URL that
  contains a ';' character. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to
  potentially execute arbitrary commands.
