title: fileutils Gem for Ruby files_utils.rb /tmp File Symlink Arbitrary File Overwrite
date: 2013-02-28
description: fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as the program creates temporary files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack against temporary files created by files_utils.rb to cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite an arbitrary file.
