title: fileutils Gem for Ruby Temporary Directory Hijacking Weakness
date: 2013-02-28
description: fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the program not verifying the existence of a directory before attempting to create it. This may allow a local attacker to create the directory in advance, thus owning any files subsequently written to it.
