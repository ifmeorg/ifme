title: ciborg Gem for Ruby default.rb /tmp/perlbrew-installer Local Symlink File Overwrite
date: 2014-06-30
description: ciborg Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as default.rb creates temporary files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack against the /tmp/perlbrew-installer file to cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite an arbitrary file.
