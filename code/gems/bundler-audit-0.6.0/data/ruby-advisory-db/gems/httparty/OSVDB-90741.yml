title: httparty Gem for Ruby Type Casting Parameter Parsing Remote Code Execution
date: 2013-01-14
description: |
  httparty Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when a type casting
  error occurs during the parsing of parameters. This may allow a
  context-dependent attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
