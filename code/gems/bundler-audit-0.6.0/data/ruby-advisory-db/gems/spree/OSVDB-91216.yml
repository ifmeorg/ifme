  Spree promotion_actions_controller.rb promotion_action Parameter Arbitrary
  Ruby Object Instantiation Command Execution

description: |
  Spree contains a flaw that is triggered when handling input passed via the
  'promotion_action' parameter to promotion_actions_controller.rb. This may
  allow a remote authenticated attacker to instantiate arbitrary Ruby objects
  and potentially execute arbitrary commands.
