  Spree Search ProductScope Class search[send][] Parameter Arbitrary Command
  Execution
date: 2011-10-05
description: |
  The ProductScope class fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input via the
  'search[send][]' parameter resulting in arbitrary command execution. With a
  specially crafted request, a remote attacker can potentially cause arbitrary
  command execution.
