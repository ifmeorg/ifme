  Spree RABL templates rendering allows Arbitrary Code Execution and File
  Disclosure
date: 2015-07-28
description: |
  Spree contains a flaw where the rendering of arbitrary RABL templates allows
  for execution arbitrary files on the host system, as well as disclosing the
  existence of files on the system. This is a different issue than
  OSVDB-125701.
