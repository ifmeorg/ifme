  Spree Multiple Script JSON Request Validation Weakness Remote Information
  Disclosure
date: 2010-11-02
description: |
  Spree contains a flaw that may lead to an unauthorized information
  disclosure. The issue is triggered when the application exchanges data using
  the JSON service without validating requests, which will disclose sensitive
  user and order information to a context-dependent attacker when a logged-in
  user visits a crafted website.
