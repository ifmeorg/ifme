title: Nokogiri Gem for Ruby External Entity (XXE) Expansion Remote DoS 
date: 2013-12-14
description: Nokogiri gem for Ruby contains an flaw that is triggered during the parsing of XML data.
  The issue is due to an incorrectly configured XML parser accepting XML external entities from
  an untrusted source. By sending specially crafted XML data, a remote attacker can cause an infinite
  loop and crash the program.
