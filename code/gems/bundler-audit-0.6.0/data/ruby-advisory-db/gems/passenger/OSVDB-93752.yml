title: Phusion Passenger Gem for Ruby Predictable Temporary Filename Generation Symlink Local Privilege Escalation
date: 2013-05-29
description: Phusion Passenger Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as the program creates
  temporary files insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink
  attack against the Nginx config file to cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite
  the file, allowing a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges.
