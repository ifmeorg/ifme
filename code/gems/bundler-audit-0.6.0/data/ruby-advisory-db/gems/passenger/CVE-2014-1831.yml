title: Phusion Passenger Server Instance Directory Creation Local Symlink File Overwrite
date: 2014-01-28
description: Phusion Passenger contains a flaw as the program creates the server instance
  directory insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack against
  the directory to cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite an arbitrary file.
