title: Phusion Passenger Server allows to overwrite headers in some cases
date: 2015-11-23
description: It is possible in some cases, for clients to overwrite headers
  set by the server, resulting in a medium level security issue.
  Passenger 5 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass headers to Ruby/Python
  applications, while Passenger 4 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass
  headers to all applications. This implies a conversion to
  UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES whereby the difference between characters
  like '-' and '_' is lost.

patched_versions:
  - "~> 4.0.60"
  - ">= 5.0.22"
