title: Directory traversal vulnerability in rubyzip
date: 2017-02-27
description: |
  The Zip::File component in the rubyzip gem before 1.2.1 for Ruby has a directory
  traversal vulnerability. If a site allows uploading of .zip files, an attacker
  can upload a malicious file that uses "../" pathname substrings to write arbitrary
  files to the filesystem.
