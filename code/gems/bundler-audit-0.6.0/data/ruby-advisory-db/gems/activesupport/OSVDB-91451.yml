title: XML Parsing Vulnerability affecting JRuby users
date: 2013-03-19

description: | 
 The ActiveSupport XML parsing functionality supports multiple
 pluggable backends. One backend supported for JRuby users is
 ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM which makes use of the
 javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder class. In some JVM configurations
 the default settings of that class can allow an attacker to construct
 XML which, when parsed, will contain the contents of arbitrary URLs
 including files from the application server. They may also allow for
 various denial of service attacks. Action Pack
