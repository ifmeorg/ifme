  Possible Denial of Service attack in Active Support

date: 2015-06-16

description: |
  Specially crafted XML documents can cause applications to raise a 
  `SystemStackError` and potentially cause a denial of service attack.  This 
  only impacts applications using REXML or JDOM as their XML processor.  Other 
  XML processors that Rails supports are not impacted. 

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

  Workarounds 
  ----------- 
  Use an XML parser that is not impacted by this problem, such as Nokogiri or 
  LibXML.  You can change the processor like this: 

    ActiveSupport::XmlMini.backend = 'Nokogiri' 

  If you cannot change XML parsers, then adjust 
  `RUBY_THREAD_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE`.
