title: Ruby on Rails SafeBuffer Object [] Direct Manipulation XSS
date: 2012-03-01

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. This flaw exists because athe application does not validate direct
  manipulations of SafeBuffer objects via '[]' and other methods. This may
  allow a user to create a specially crafted request that would execute
  arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust relationship
  between their browser and the server.
