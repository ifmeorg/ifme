title: Ruby on Rails HTML Escaping Code XSS
date: 2012-08-09

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. This flaw exists because the HTML escaping code functionality does
  not properly escape a single quote character. This may allow a user to create
  a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a
  user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the
  server.
