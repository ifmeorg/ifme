  Ruby on Rails JSON Parser Crafted Payload YAML Subset Decoding Remote Code
  Execution 
date: 2013-01-28

description: |
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw in the JSON parser. Rails supports multiple
  parsing backends, one of which involves transforming JSON into YAML via the
  YAML parser. With a specially crafted payload, an attacker can subvert the
  backend into decoding a subset of YAML. This may allow a remote attacker to
  bypass restrictions, allowing them to bypass authentication systems, inject
  arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on
  a Rails application.
