title: multi_xml Gem for Ruby XML Parameter Parsing Remote Command Execution 
date: 2013-01-11

description: |
  The multi_xml Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when an error
  occurs during the parsing of the 'XML' parameter. With a crafted request
  containing arbitrary symbol and yaml types, a remote attacker can execute
  arbitrary commands.
