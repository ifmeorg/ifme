date: 2013-04-04
description: kelredd-pruview Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/pruview/document.rb. The issue is triggered during the handling of a specially crafted file name that contains injected shell metacharacters. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands.
