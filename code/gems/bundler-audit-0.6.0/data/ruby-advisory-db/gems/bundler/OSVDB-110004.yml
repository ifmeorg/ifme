title: Bundler Gem for Ruby Multiple Top-level Source Lines Gemfile Handling Gem Installation Spoofing
date: 2014-08-13
description: |
  Bundler Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when handling
  a gemfile that contains multiple top-level source lines. This may allow a
  context-dependent attacker to install specially crafted gems on a remote
  system, leading to arbitrary code execution.
