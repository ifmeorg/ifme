title: Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager rubygem-ldap_fluff Active Directory Authentication Bypass
date: 2012-12-04
description: Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager contains a flaw in the
  rubygem-ldap_fluff component. The issue is triggered when using Microsoft
  Active Directory server as the authentication back-end. This may result in
  authentication no longer being enforced, allowing a remote attacker to
  trivially bypass it.
