title: Paperclip Gem for Ruby contains a flaw
date: 2014-01-31
description: Paperclip Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is due to the application failing to properly
  validate the file extension, instead only validating the Content-Type header during file uploads.
  This may allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions on file types for uploaded files by
  spoofing the content-type.
