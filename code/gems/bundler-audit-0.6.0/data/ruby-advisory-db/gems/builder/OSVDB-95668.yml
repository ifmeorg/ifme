title: Builder Gem for Ruby Tag Name Handling Private Method Exposure
date: 2007-06-15
description: |
  Builder Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the handling of tag names. The issue
  is triggered when the program reads tag names from XML data and then calls a
  method with that name. With a specially crafted file, a context-dependent
  attacker can call private methods and manipulate data.
