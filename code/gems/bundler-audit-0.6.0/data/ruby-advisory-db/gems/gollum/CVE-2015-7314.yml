title: gollum Upload File Functionality Permits Arbitrary File Access
date: 2015-09-20
description: |
  The gollum gem contains a flaw in its upload file functionality that can
  allow arbitrary file access. This occurs due to a lack of type checking
  when handling temporary files during the upload process.
