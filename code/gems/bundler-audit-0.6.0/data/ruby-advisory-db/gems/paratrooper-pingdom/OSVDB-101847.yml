title: paratrooper-pingdom Gem for Ruby /lib/paratrooper-pingdom.rb API Login Credentials Local Disclosure
date: 2013-12-26
description: |
  paratrooper-pingdom Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in
  /lib/paratrooper-pingdom.rb. The issue is triggered when the script exposes
  API login credentials, allowing a local attacker to gain access to the API
  key, username, and password for the API login by monitoring the process tree.
cvss_v2: 2.1
