title: Fat Free CRM Gem for Ruby allows remote attackers to inject or
  manipulate SQL queries
date: 2013-12-24
description: |
  Fat Free CRM contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection
  attack. The issue is due to the app/controllers/home_controller.rb script
  not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'state' parameter or
  input passed via comments and emails. This may allow a remote attacker to
  inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for
  the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
