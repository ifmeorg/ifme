title: Fat Free CRM Gem for Ruby allows remote attackers to obtain
  sensitive informations
date: 2013-12-24
description: |
  Fat Free CRM contains a flaw in user controllers that is triggered as JSON
  requests are rendered with a full JSON object. This may allow a remote
  attacker to gain access to potentially sensitive information e.g. other
  users password hashes.
