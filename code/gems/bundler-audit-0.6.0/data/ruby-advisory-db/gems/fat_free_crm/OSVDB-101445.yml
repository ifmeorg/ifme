title: Fat Free CRM Gem for Ruby lack of support for cycling the Rails
  session secret
date: 2013-12-24
description: |
  Fat Free CRM contains a flaw that is due to the application defining a static
  security session token in config/initialiers/secret_token.rb. If a remote
  attacker has explicit knowledge of this token, they can potentially execute
  arbitrary code.
