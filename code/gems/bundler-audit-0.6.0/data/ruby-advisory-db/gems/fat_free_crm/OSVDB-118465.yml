title: Fat Free CRM Gem being vulnerable to CSRF-type attacks
date: 2015-02-16
description: |
  Fat Free CRM contains a flaw as HTTP requests to /admin/users do not require
  multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing
  certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into following a specially
  crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request
  Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to creating administrative
  users.
