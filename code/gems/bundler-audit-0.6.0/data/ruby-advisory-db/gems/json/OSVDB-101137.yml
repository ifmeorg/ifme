title: json Gem for Ruby JSON::GenericObject Function Arbitrary Addition Creation
date: 2013-02-04
description: |
  json Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the JSON::GenericObject function. The
  issue is due to the program failing to restrict users from creating additions
  regardless of the state of create_additions. This may allow a remote attacker
  to create arbitrary additions.
