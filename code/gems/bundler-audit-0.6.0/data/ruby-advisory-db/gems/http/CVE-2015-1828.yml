title: HTTPS MitM vulnerability in http.rb
date: 2015-03-24
description: |
  http.rb failed to call the OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#post_connection_check method to perform hostname verification.
  Because of this, an attacker with a valid certificate but with a mismatched subject can perform a MitM attack.
