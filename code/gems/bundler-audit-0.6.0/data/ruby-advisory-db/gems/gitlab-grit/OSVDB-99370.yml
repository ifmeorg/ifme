title: GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw
date: 2013-11-04
description: GitLab Grit Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the app/contexts/search_context.rb script.
  The issue is triggered when input passed via the code search box is not properly sanitized,
  which allows strings to be evaluated by the Bourne shell. This may allow a remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary commands.
