This repository houses the `turbolinks` RubyGem, which provides a Rails engine for [Turbolinks 5](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) support.

It depends on the [`turbolinks-source`](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks-source-gem) RubyGem, which packages the Turbolinks JavaScript assets for the Rails asset pipeline.
