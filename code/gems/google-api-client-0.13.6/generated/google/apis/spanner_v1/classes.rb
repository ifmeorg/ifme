      # The request for BeginTransaction.
      class BeginTransactionRequest
        include Google::Apis::Core::Hashable
      
        # # Transactions
        # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
        # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
        # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
        # new session for each transaction.
        # # Transaction Modes
        # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
        # 1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
        # to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
        # pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
        # Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
        # application to retry.
        # 2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
        # consistency across several reads, but does not allow
        # writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
        # read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
        # transactions do not need to be committed.
        # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
        # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
        # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
        # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
        # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
        # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
        # database.
        # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
        # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
        # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
        # consistent.
        # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
        # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
        # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
        # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by
        # Commit or
        # Rollback.  Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
        # transaction's locks and abort it.
        # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
        # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
        # have been completed.
        # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
        # reads or SQL queries followed by
        # Commit. At any time before
        # Commit, the client can send a
        # Rollback request to abort the
        # transaction.
        # ### Semantics
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
        # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
        # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
        # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
        # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
        # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
        # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
        # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
        # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
        # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
        # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
        # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
        # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
        # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
        # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
        # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
        # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
        # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
        # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
        # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
        # retrying.
        # ### Idle Transactions
        # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
        # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
        # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
        # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
        # fail with error `ABORTED`.
        # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
        # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
        # transaction from becoming idle.
        # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
        # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
        # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
        # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
        # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
        # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
        # concurrent read-write transactions.
        # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
        # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
        # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
        # need to worry about this in practice.
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
        # Commit or
        # Rollback (and in fact are not
        # permitted to do so).
        # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
        # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
        # The types of timestamp bound are:
        # - Strong (the default).
        # - Bounded staleness.
        # - Exact staleness.
        # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
        # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
        # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
        # from the leader replica.
        # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
        # ### Strong
        # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
        # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
        # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
        # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction.
        # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
        # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
        # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
        # timestamp.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
        # ### Exact Staleness
        # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
        # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
        # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
        # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
        # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
        # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
        # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
        # <= the read timestamp have finished.
        # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
        # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
        # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
        # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
        # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
        # ### Bounded Staleness
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
        # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
        # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
        # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
        # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
        # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
        # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
        # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

        # ### Bounded Staleness
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
        # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
        # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
        # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
        # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
        # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
        # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
        # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

      # Keys are represented by lists, where the ith value in the list
      # corresponds to the ith component of the table or index primary key.
      # Individual values are encoded as described here.
      # For example, consider the following table definition:
      # CREATE TABLE UserEvents (
      # UserName STRING(MAX),
      # EventDate STRING(10)
      # ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);
      # The following keys name rows in this table:
      # "Bob", "2014-09-23"
      # Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two
      # columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is the
      # `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.
      # Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted
      # lexicographically by component using the table or index key's declared
      # sort order. For example, the following range returns all events for
      # user `"Bob"` that occurred in the year 2015:
      # "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"]
      # "end_closed": ["Bob", "2015-12-31"]
      # Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the
      # inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key
      # components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the
      # provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows
      # that exactly match are not included.
      # For example, the following range includes all events for `"Bob"` that
      # occurred during and after the year 2000:
      # "start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]
      # "end_closed": ["Bob"]
      # The next example retrieves all events for `"Bob"`:
      # "start_closed": ["Bob"]
      # "end_closed": ["Bob"]
      # To retrieve events before the year 2000:
      # "start_closed": ["Bob"]
      # "end_open": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]
      # The following range includes all rows in the table:
      # "start_closed": []
      # "end_closed": []
      # This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with any

      # "start_closed": ["A"]

      # This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B:
      # "start_closed": ["B"]

        # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        # # Overview
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        # # Language mapping
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        # # Other uses
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        # errors.
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        # have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        # `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        # each error sub-response.
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        # results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        # represented directly using the `Status` message.
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        # be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

        # field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively

        # # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.
        # ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]

      # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
      # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
      # - Simple to use and understand for most users
      # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
      # # Overview
      # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
      # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
      # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
      # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
      # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
      # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
      # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
      # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
      # # Language mapping
      # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
      # # Other uses
      # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
      # consistent developer experience across different environments.
      # Example uses of this error model include:
      # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
      # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
      # errors.
      # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
      # have a `Status` message for error reporting.
      # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
      # `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
      # each error sub-response.
      # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
      # results in its response, the status of those operations should be
      # represented directly using the `Status` message.
      # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
      # be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

      # # Transactions
      # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
      # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
      # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
      # new session for each transaction.
      # # Transaction Modes
      # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
      # 1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
      # to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
      # pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
      # Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
      # application to retry.
      # 2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
      # consistency across several reads, but does not allow
      # writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
      # read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
      # transactions do not need to be committed.
      # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
      # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
      # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
      # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
      # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
      # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
      # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
      # database.
      # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
      # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
      # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
      # consistent.
      # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
      # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
      # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
      # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
      # transaction has not been terminated by
      # Commit or
      # Rollback.  Long periods of
      # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
      # transaction's locks and abort it.
      # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
      # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
      # have been completed.
      # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
      # reads or SQL queries followed by
      # Commit. At any time before
      # Commit, the client can send a
      # Rollback request to abort the
      # transaction.
      # ### Semantics
      # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
      # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
      # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
      # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
      # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
      # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
      # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
      # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
      # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
      # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
      # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
      # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
      # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
      # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
      # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
      # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
      # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
      # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
      # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
      # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
      # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
      # retrying.
      # ### Idle Transactions
      # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
      # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
      # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
      # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
      # fail with error `ABORTED`.
      # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
      # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
      # transaction from becoming idle.
      # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
      # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
      # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
      # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
      # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
      # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
      # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
      # concurrent read-write transactions.
      # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
      # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
      # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
      # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
      # need to worry about this in practice.
      # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
      # Commit or
      # Rollback (and in fact are not
      # permitted to do so).
      # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
      # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
      # The types of timestamp bound are:
      # - Strong (the default).
      # - Bounded staleness.
      # - Exact staleness.
      # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
      # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
      # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
      # from the leader replica.
      # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
      # ### Strong
      # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
      # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
      # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
      # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
      # see the transaction.
      # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
      # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
      # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
      # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
      # timestamp.
      # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
      # ### Exact Staleness
      # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
      # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
      # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
      # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
      # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
      # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
      # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
      # <= the read timestamp have finished.
      # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
      # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
      # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
      # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
      # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
      # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
      # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
      # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
      # ### Bounded Staleness
      # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
      # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
      # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
      # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
      # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
      # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
      # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
      # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
      # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
      # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
      # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
      # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
      # timestamp.
      # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
      # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
      # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
      # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
      # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
      # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
      # read-only transactions.

      # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
      # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
      # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
      # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
      # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
      # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
      # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
      # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

        # # Transactions
        # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
        # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
        # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
        # new session for each transaction.
        # # Transaction Modes
        # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
        # 1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
        # to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
        # pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
        # Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
        # application to retry.
        # 2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
        # consistency across several reads, but does not allow
        # writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
        # read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
        # transactions do not need to be committed.
        # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
        # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
        # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
        # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
        # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
        # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
        # database.
        # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
        # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
        # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
        # consistent.
        # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
        # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
        # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
        # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by
        # Commit or
        # Rollback.  Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
        # transaction's locks and abort it.
        # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
        # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
        # have been completed.
        # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
        # reads or SQL queries followed by
        # Commit. At any time before
        # Commit, the client can send a
        # Rollback request to abort the
        # transaction.
        # ### Semantics
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
        # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
        # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
        # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
        # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
        # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
        # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
        # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
        # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
        # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
        # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
        # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
        # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
        # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
        # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
        # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
        # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
        # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
        # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
        # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
        # retrying.
        # ### Idle Transactions
        # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
        # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
        # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
        # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
        # fail with error `ABORTED`.
        # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
        # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
        # transaction from becoming idle.
        # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
        # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
        # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
        # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
        # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
        # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
        # concurrent read-write transactions.
        # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
        # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
        # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
        # need to worry about this in practice.
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
        # Commit or
        # Rollback (and in fact are not
        # permitted to do so).
        # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
        # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
        # The types of timestamp bound are:
        # - Strong (the default).
        # - Bounded staleness.
        # - Exact staleness.
        # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
        # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
        # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
        # from the leader replica.
        # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
        # ### Strong
        # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
        # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
        # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
        # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction.
        # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
        # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
        # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
        # timestamp.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
        # ### Exact Staleness
        # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
        # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
        # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
        # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
        # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
        # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
        # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
        # <= the read timestamp have finished.
        # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
        # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
        # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
        # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
        # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
        # ### Bounded Staleness
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
