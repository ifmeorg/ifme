        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,

        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        # # Language mapping
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        # # Other uses
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        # errors.
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        # have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        # `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        # each error sub-response.
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        # results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        # represented directly using the `Status` message.
