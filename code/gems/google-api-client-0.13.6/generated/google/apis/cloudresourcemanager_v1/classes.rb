        # connection attempts will be allowed.

        # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
        # values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
        # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
        # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
        # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
        # not present in `denied_values`.
        # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`
        # `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of
        # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.
        # Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that
        # restricts the allowed API activations to ``E1`, `E2``. Then, if a
        # `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has
        # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
        # then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.
        # The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings:
        # Example 1 (no inherited values):
        # `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
        # `allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”`
        # ``projects/bar`` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values:
        # `allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"`
        # The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
        # The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.
        # Example 2 (inherited values):
        # `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
        # `allowed_values: “E1” allowed_values:”E2”`

        # The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
        # The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.
        # Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):
        # `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
        # `allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"`
        # `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:

        # The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.
        # The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.

        # `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values:

        # the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if
        # `DENY`, none).
        # Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy):
        # `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set.
        # `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.

        # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        # # Overview
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        # # Language mapping
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        # # Other uses
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        # errors.
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may

      # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
      # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
      # - Simple to use and understand for most users
      # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
      # # Overview
      # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
      # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
      # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
      # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
      # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
      # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
      # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
      # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
      # # Language mapping
      # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
      # # Other uses
      # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
      # consistent developer experience across different environments.
      # Example uses of this error model include:
      # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
      # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
      # errors.
      # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
      # have a `Status` message for error reporting.
      # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
      # `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
      # each error sub-response.
      # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
      # results in its response, the status of those operations should be
      # represented directly using the `Status` message.
      # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
      # be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
