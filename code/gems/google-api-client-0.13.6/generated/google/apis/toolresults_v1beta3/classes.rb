      # `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
      # URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
      # Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of
      # utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
      # Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
      # Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) ` ... `
      # Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
      # Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) ` foo = any.
      # unpack(Foo.class); `
      # Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
      # foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.

      # The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.
      # googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use
      # the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example "
      # foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z".
      # JSON ==== The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
      # representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field
      # `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:
      # package google.profile; message Person ` string first_name = 1; string
      # last_name = 2; `
      # ` "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName": , "
      # lastName":  `
      # If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
      # representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value`
      # which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for
      # message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):
      # ` "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration", "value": "1.212s" `

      # A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a
      # count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is
      # independent of any calendar and concepts like "day" or "month". It is related
      # to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values is a Duration
      # and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-
      # 10,000 years.
      # # Examples
      # Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
      # Timestamp start = ...; Timestamp end = ...; Duration duration = ...;
      # duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds; duration.nanos = end.nanos -

      # 1; duration.nanos += 1000000000; `

      # end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds; end.nanos = start.nanos +

        # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
        # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [
        # gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
        # unexpected needs
        # # Overview
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][
        # ], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message
        # should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand*
        # and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed,
        # put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client.
        # The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error.
        # There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc`
        # that can be used for common error conditions.
        # # Language mapping
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        # # Other uses
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer
        # experience across different environments.
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        # errors.
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a
        # `Status` message for error reporting.
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `
        # Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each
        # error sub-response.
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        # results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented
        # directly using the `Status` message.
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        # be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

        # # JSON Mapping
        # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](
        # https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "`year`-`
        # month`-`day`T`hour`:`min`:`sec`[.`frac_sec`]Z" where `year` is always
        # expressed using four digits while `month`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec` are
        # zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9
        # digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix
        # indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as
        # indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
        # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on
        # January 15, 2017.
        # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard
        # [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/
        # Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `
        # datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](
        # https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time
        # format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda
        # Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/

      # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [
      # gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
      # - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
      # unexpected needs
      # # Overview
      # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][
      # ], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message
      # should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand*
      # and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed,
      # put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client.
      # The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error.
      # There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc`
      # that can be used for common error conditions.
      # # Language mapping
      # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
      # # Other uses
      # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer
      # experience across different environments.
      # Example uses of this error model include:
      # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
      # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
      # errors.
      # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a
      # `Status` message for error reporting.
      # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `
      # Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each
      # error sub-response.
      # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
      # results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented
      # directly using the `Status` message.
      # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
      # be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

      # digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix
      # indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as
      # indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
      # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on

        # A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or

        # resolution in UTC Epoch time. It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian
        # Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is
        # encoded assuming all minutes are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "
        # smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range is
        # from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to
        # that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings.
        # See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.
        # txt).
        # # Examples
        # Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.
        # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0);
        # Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.
        # struct timeval tv; gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
        # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.
        # tv_usec * 1000);
        # Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
        # FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.
        # dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
        # // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z // is
        # 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Timestamp
        # timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
        # timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
        # Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
        # long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        # Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000) .
        # setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
        # Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
        # timestamp = Timestamp() timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
        # # JSON Mapping
        # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](
        # https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "`year`-`
        # month`-`day`T`hour`:`min`:`sec`[.`frac_sec`]Z" where `year` is always
        # expressed using four digits while `month`, `day`, `hour`, `min`, and `sec` are
        # zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9
        # digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix
        # indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as
        # indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
        # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on
        # January 15, 2017.
        # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard
        # [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/
        # Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `
        # datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](
        # https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time
        # format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda
        # Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/
        # apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a
        # formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
