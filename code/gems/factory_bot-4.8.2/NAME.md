# Why is this project called "Factory Girl"?

The name "Factory Girl" might be confusing to some developers who encounter this
library.

[We chose the name](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/waiting-for-a-factory-girl) as
a nod in the direction of the [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
and [Object Mother](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) software
patterns from the _Design Patterns_ book, and as a reference to the
[Rolling Stones song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jKix2DFlnA) of the same
name.
