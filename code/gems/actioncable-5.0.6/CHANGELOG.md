*   Permit same-origin connections by default.

    New option `config.action_cable.allow_same_origin_as_host = false`
    to disable.

    *Dávid Halász*, *Matthew Draper*

*   Fixed and added a workaround to avoid race condition, when one
    thread closed the IO, when an another thread was still trying read
    from IO on a connection.

    *Matthew Draper*

*   Shutdown pubsub connection before classes are reloaded, to avoid
    hangups caused by pubsub still holding reference to Active Record
    connection from the pool, and Active Record trying to cleanup the pool.

    *Jon Moss*

*   Prevent race where the client could receive and act upon a
    subscription confirmation before the channel's `subscribed` method
    completed.

    Fixes #25381.

    *Vladimir Dementyev*

*   Buffer writes to websocket connections, to avoid blocking threads
    that could be doing more useful things.

    *Matthew Draper*, *Tinco Andringa*

*   Invocation of channel action is now prevented, if subscription
    connection was rejected.

    Fixes #23757.

    *Jon Moss*

*   Protect against concurrent writes to a websocket connection from
    multiple threads; the underlying OS write is not always threadsafe.

    *Tinco Andringa*

*   Close hijacked socket when connection is shut down.

    Fixes #25613.

    *Tinco Andringa*


## Rails 5.0.0 (June 30, 2016) ##

*   Fix development reloading support: new cable connections are now correctly
    dispatched to the reloaded channel class, instead of using a cached reference
    to the originally-loaded version.

    *Matthew Draper*

*   WebSocket protocol negotiation.

    Introduces an Action Cable protocol version that moves independently
    of and, hopefully, more slowly than Action Cable itself. Client sockets
    negotiate a protocol with the Cable server using WebSockets' native
    subprotocol support:
      * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.9
      * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#Subprotocols

    If they can't negotiate a compatible protocol (usually due to upgrading
    the Cable server with a browser still running old JavaScript) then the
    client knows to disconnect, cease retrying, and tell the app that it hit
    a protocol mismatch.

    This allows us to evolve the Action Cable message format, handshaking,
    pings, acknowledgements, and more without breaking older clients'
    expectations of server behavior.

    *Daniel Rhodes*

*   Pubsub: automatic stream decoding.

        stream_for @room, coder: ActiveSupport::JSON do |message|
          # `message` is a Ruby hash here instead of a JSON string

    The `coder` must respond to `#decode`. Defaults to `coder: nil`
    which skips decoding entirely.

    *Jeremy Daer*

*   Add ActiveSupport::Notifications to ActionCable::Channel.

    *Matthew Wear*

*   Safely support autoloading and class unloading, by preventing concurrent
    loads, and disconnecting all cables during reload.

    *Matthew Draper*

*   Ensure ActionCable behaves correctly for non-string queue names.

    *Jay Hayes*

*   Added `em_redis_connector` and `redis_connector` to
   `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter::EventedRedis` and added `redis_connector`
    to `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter::Redis`, so you can overwrite with your
    own initializers. This is used when you want to use different-than-standard
    Redis adapters, like for Makara distributed Redis.

    *DHH*

*   Support PostgreSQL pubsub adapter.

    *Jon Moss*

*   Remove EventMachine dependency.

    *Matthew Draper*

*   Remove Celluloid dependency.

    *Mike Perham*

*   Create notion of an `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter`.
    Separate out Redis functionality into
    `ActionCable::SubscriptionAdapter::Redis`, and add a
    PostgreSQL adapter as well. Configuration file for
    ActionCable was changed from`config/redis/cable.yml` to
    `config/cable.yml`.

    *Jon Moss*

*   Added to Rails!

    *DHH*
