This document contains example output to show RDoc styling.  This file was
created from a Markdown file.

For the following styles, see ExampleRDoc.rdoc for style examples:

* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Code blocks (verbatim sections)
* Definition lists
* Ordered lists
* Unordered lists

These items all use the same styles as RDoc format files.

## Footnotes

Footnotes are rendered at the bottom of the documentation section[^1].  For
pages this will be at the bottom of the page.  For method documentation this
will be at the end of the current method.

[^1]: Here is the footnote content.  As you can see it is at the bottom of the
page.

## Blockquotes

Here is how a blockquote looks.

> We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Now, how the hell do
> we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? and attack
> the Romulans.
>
> > Sorry, Data. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. The unexpected is
> > our normal routine. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for
> > 75 years?
