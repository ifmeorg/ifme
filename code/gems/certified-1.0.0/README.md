# Certified

# HEY!

Always remember to keep your certificate bundle up to date using the included `certified-update` executable!

Solves http://martinottenwaelter.fr/2010/12/ruby19-and-the-ssl-error/ by providing a crt bundle and explicitly telling Ruby where to find it. Also forces `OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER`

<pre>gem install certified</pre>
