== TODO

- clean up history
- change default position back to "top" for all annotations
- change 'exclude' to 'only' (double negatives are not unconfusing)

== TODO (proposed)

- push two identical gems, named 'annotate' and 'annotate_models'
- supply two binaries, named 'annotate' and 'annotate_models', since there's already a unix tool named 'annotate'
- test EVERYTHING
